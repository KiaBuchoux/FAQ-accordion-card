## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 
- Flexbox


### What I learned

CSS: 
- Position: relative & absolute - to put the img to exactly where we wanted
- Flexbox is really practical when it comes to center items: alight-item/ justfy-content
- transform: translate X/Y - to position items on the page 
- z-index 

JS
- .toggle() method - although very little JS still glad I've learnt something new ╰(*°▽°*)╯.


### Continued development

HTML:
- How to better name the classes 

CSS:
- specificity
- and lots of other confusing trucs...
